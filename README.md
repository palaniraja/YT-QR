# Youtube - Quick reference


Quicker way to browse youtube video contents. 

I consume lot of technical videos (conference talks and tutorials), scrubbing videos to the part you want to have another look is hard. Blog has an advantage that I can just scroll through and read the part I want to refer again. 

It is harder to skip relevant section, most of the time it is mostly trial and error. This app lets you use youtube autogenerated caption to search & skip the part you are interested in.
